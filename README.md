# 📊 Clinical Risk Factor Analysis Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# 🎯 Objective

This project aims to analyze key health indicators such as age, BMI, blood glucose levels, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, and diabetes prevalence to identify risk factors for chronic diseases. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, we derive insights that can aid clinical decision-making and healthcare policy recommendations.

# 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains patient demographics, lifestyle factors, and medical conditions.

# 📌 Dependent Variable (Target):

✔ Diabetes (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

# 📌 Independent Variables (Features):

✔ Age – Older individuals may have a higher risk of chronic diseases.

✔ Gender – Potential BMI and disease prevalence differences across genders.

✔ Smoking History – Smoking may impact blood glucose and heart disease risk.

✔ Blood Glucose Level – Key indicator of diabetes.

✔ BMI – High BMI could be linked to diabetes and hypertension.

✔ Hypertension & Heart Disease – Key comorbidities in diabetes risk.

✔ Race – Understanding disparities in disease prevalence.

# 🔄 Step-by-Step Analysis Process

Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

✔ Univariate Analysis – Distribution of age, BMI, blood glucose levels, etc.

✔ Bivariate Analysis – Identifying relationships between risk factors.

# 📊 Key Findings from EDA:

✔ Smoking history correlates with higher blood glucose levels.

✔ Diabetes prevalence increases with age.

✔ BMI distribution shows slight variation between males and females.

✔ Weak positive correlation between BMI and diabetes, indicating other contributing factors.

# 🏗️ Data Processing & Cleaning

✔ Missing Values – Handled using mean/mode imputation.

✔ Categorical Variables – Converted race columns into a single categorical variable.

✔ Outlier Detection – Box plots for BMI, blood glucose levels, and HbA1c.

# 📊 Statistical & Visual Insights

# 📌 Univariate Analysis:

✔ Histograms & Box Plots for age, BMI, and blood glucose levels.

✔ Summary statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation).

# 📌 Bivariate Analysis:

✔ Age vs. Blood Glucose Level – Older individuals tend to have higher blood glucose levels.

✔ Smoking History vs. Blood Glucose Level – Smokers have higher variability in blood glucose levels.

✔ BMI vs. Diabetes – A weak correlation exists between BMI and diabetes.

✔ Hypertension vs. Heart Disease – Strong association between these conditions.

✔ Race vs. Diabetes – Identifies disparities in diabetes prevalence among different racial groups.

# 📊 Visualizations & Charts Used

✔ Scatter Plots – Age vs. BMI, BMI vs. Blood Glucose Level.

✔ Box Plots – BMI and Blood Glucose Level (to identify outliers).

✔ Histograms – Age and Blood Glucose Level distribution.

✔ Pivot Tables & Bar Charts – Gender vs. Heart Disease, Smoking History vs. Diabetes.

✔ Stacked Bar Charts – Race vs. Diabetes.

# 🚀 Final Insights & Business Implications

✔ Older individuals and smokers show higher risk factors for diabetes and heart disease.

✔ BMI is not a sole indicator of diabetes; other factors like smoking and age play a major role.

✔ Preventive healthcare strategies should target high-risk groups based on these insights.

✔ Hospitals and clinics can use these findings to develop targeted wellness programs.

# 🔮 Future Recommendations & Next Steps

# 📌 Advanced Model Building:

✔ Implement Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for predictive analysis.

✔ Incorporate time-series trends for diabetes progression.

✔ Enhance feature engineering with additional lifestyle and genetic factors.

# 📌 Clinical Applications:

✔ Develop personalized intervention plans for at-risk patients.

✔ Use data insights to optimize preventive healthcare strategies.

✔ Partner with public health programs to mitigate chronic disease risks.

# 📌 This project serves as a foundation for clinical decision-making and predictive healthcare analytics. 🚀
